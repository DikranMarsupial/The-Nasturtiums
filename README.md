## The Notebooks

loehe_scafetta_2011.ipynb 

a basic implementation of the Loehle and Scafetta [1] (LS11) cyclic model of global mean surface temperature.  This notebook
just downloads the latest HadCRUT4-gl dataset from CRU and plots the LS11 model using the parameters given by [1], allowing us to see how the model's predctions have fared against the observations (rather badly).
