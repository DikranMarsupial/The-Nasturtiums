# The Nasturtiums 

This repository is the home for Dikran Marsupial's unsorted collection of climate related Jupyter notebooks.  Why "The Nasturtiums"?  When Bertie Wooster gets arrested by the police, ge generally gives his name and address as "Ephraim Gadsby of The Nasturtiums, Jubilee Road, Stertham Commmon."  I don't know why, it's just a whim [1].

## The Notebooks:

### loehe_scafetta_2011.ipynb 

This notebook provides a basic implementation of the Loehle and Scafetta [2], hereafter LS11, cyclic model of global mean surface temperature.  This notebook just downloads the latest HadCRUT4-gl dataset from CRU and plots the LS11 model using the parameters given by [2], allowing us to see how the model's predctions have fared against the observations (rather badly).
